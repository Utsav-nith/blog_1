RuntimeError - Ransack needs Post attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `Post`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:
```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)
    ["content", "created_at", "id", "id_value", "title", "updated_at"]
  end
